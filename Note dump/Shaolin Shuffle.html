The third player draws gain 1 Chi. The fourth player draws a card *and* gains 1 Chi.</div><div><br/></div><div>On your turn, you may either <b>Attack</b> or <b>Focus</b></div><div>To <b>Attack</b>:</div><div>Expend a &quot;Maneuver&quot; card. The basic effect of the maneuver is listed on the card.</div><div>1. ) You may choose to modify your attack using &quot;Style&quot; cards. You may use 0,1, or 2  &quot;Style&quot; cards on a single Manuever. </div><div>2.) The exception are the two wild cards, which may not be modified. They also consume <b>Chi</b> to play.</div><div>3.) You may only use unique &quot;Styles&quot;. &quot;(No Iron Iron Kick, for instance.)</div><div>4.) When you make an <b>Attack</b> you must declare a target. &quot;I use Heavenly Monkey Kick on Bob&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>Reactions.</div><div>1.) You may only play &quot;Reaction&quot; Maneuvers on another player's turn. ((**HACK** - Should you be able to block other people's attacks? I think yes.))</div><div>2.) A &quot;Reaction&quot; Maneuver is resolved before the triggering effect. </div><div>3.) You may only play 1 Reaction maneuver per Technique.</div><div>4.) The Style effects of a Manuever and additional effects of a Technique take place even if the attack is Blocked or Countered. But not if the attack is Cancelled.</div><div><br/></div><div>If an attack drops a player to zero health tokens, they are &quot;Knocked Out&quot; and out of the game. ((**HACK** They *might* keep their Chi pool, which they can spend on other player's behalf...))</div><div><br/></div><div>The game ends with the last martial artist standing.</div><div><br/></div><div>To <b>Focus</b>:</div><div>Gain 1 Chi. You may then immediately use any number of Chi to draw cards before your turn is over.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Cards:</b></div><div>Simply put, these are the pool of moves you can create on a given turn. They exist in your hand, your opponent's hands, the draw pile, and the discard pile. Hands have a maximum size of 7 cards. If an effect would have you gain cards in excess of seven, you may take the cards, and then discard down to seven. If you need to draw cards and the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and place face down as the new draw pile. </div><div><br/></div><div>EFFECT:</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>CHI:</div><div>Chi represents a valuable focus and resource that all high-level martial artists draw upon, consciously or subconsciously. You begin play with 3 or 4 Chi tokens, and the tokens can be used in several ways:</div><div><br/></div><div>1.) Draw 2 cards. </div><div>  a.) This may only be used on your turn.</div><div>  b.) You may spend as much Chi as you like.</div><div>  c.) If you draw in excess of 7 cards, you must discard down to 7 at the end of your turn.</div><div>2.) +2 Effect on a Maneuver. </div><div>  a.) Must be declared when playing the maneuver.</div><div>  b.) This boost may only be used once per technique.</div><div>  c.) If a maneuver is canceled or otherwise fails to activate, the Chi token is not refunded.</div><div>3.) Reduce incoming damage by 2.</div><div>  a.) You may spend as much Chi as you like to reduce damage.</div><div><br/></div><div>HEALTH:</div><div>Your Health tokens represent your remaining stamina. Attacks typically damage your Health pool. When you run out of Health, you are Knocked Out. Discard your remaining cards. You have brought grave dishonor to your Sifu.</div><div><br/></div><div>Occassionally, a technique will allow you to spend or manipulate your health tokens. Specifics will be found on any cards that allow this.</div><div><br/></div><div>WILD CARDS</div><div>There are two Wild Cards in the deck. Each of them has an Offensive and Defensive Option. Each costs 3 Chi tokens to activate. Details are on the specific cards.</div><div><br/></div><div>Style Cards and Maneuver Cards: The remaining 52 cards in the deck are  Technique cards. Each Technique card has both a &quot;Style&quot; and &quot;Maneuver&quot; listed. The Technique cards may be played in one of two ways: Style or Maneuver orientation. There are different options printed on each, so each card allows you a choice in how to use it. When attacking, you must declare the full name of your attack as well as your target. Styles must be unique for an attack. You may not use the same descriptor twice.</div><div><br/></div><div>**HACK** Wouldn't it be fun to give a special bonus to someone who yells the name of their attack when they knock an opponent out? Maybe 1 Chi token for taking someone out.</div><div>**HACK** Maybe  a bonus for coming up with a Kung-Fu name for their character?</div><br/></div><div><hr/>
Expansion: Heavenly Artifacts and Advantages</div><div>-&gt; You may add up to six special effect cards to the deck for a given battle. </div><div>These special effect cards may be additional techniques, super moves, or new *effects*. </div><div>Effects are cards that cost Chi to put into play, but give ongoing effects until they are taken out.</div><div><br/></div><div><div>Special effect /expansion cards.</div>
Six cards.  They are one sided effects that cost chi to play and give semi permanent effects
<div><br/></div>
Retainer : +1 effect on attacks.  Has 3 health that is targeted first.
<div><br/></div>
Drunken style : can pay 1 chi to gain bonus and add drunken prefix.  Can't take reactions while it is out.
<div><br/></div>
Sword.  Attacks ignore 2 points of reduction.  Chi spent by defender breaks the sword.
<div><br/></div>
Thunder  style.  Discard to make opponent unable to use reactions.</div><div><br/></div><div>health bell: Bell starts play with 5 health. Each turn, it transfers one health to the owner. If it runs otu of health to transfer, it shatters.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><div>FOUR SCHOOLS WILL DO BATTLE!</div><div>As far as boosts: Each school should have it's own &quot;+1 Effect&quot; plethora, and +2 Effect, I think.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Quick, bastard school: SPADE</b></div><div>Techniques: Counter x2, Guard x2 | Jab x2, Palm x1, Whirlwind x2, Avalanche x1, Lock x1, Punch x1, Knee x1</div><div>Styles: Lightning x2, Zen x2, Stone x1, Serpent x3, Monkey x2, Darting x3 (+1 Effect)</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Flowing, gentle school: HEART</b></div><div>Techniques: Meditation x3, Guard x1, Counter x1, Rejuvenation x1 | Finger x2, Lock x1, Sweep x1, Palm x1, Fist x2</div><div>Styles: Dragon x2, Zen x2, Stone x1, Spirit x3, Phoenix x1, Transcendent x1, Harmonious x3 (+1 Effect)</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Powerful crushing school: CLUB</b></div><div>Techniques: Rejuvenation x2, Block x2, Jab x 1, Throw x2, Sweep x1, Meteor x1, Punch x1, Uppercut x1, Knee x1, Kick x1</div><div>Styles: Basilisk x2, Zen x2, Stone x3, Tiger x2 (+2 Effect), Phoenix x1, Iron x3 (+1 Effect)</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Balanced school: DIAMOND</b></div><div>Techniques: Rejuvenation x1, Meditation x1, Block x2, Guard x1 | Palm x1, Throw x1, Sweep x1, Whirlwind x1, Punch x1, Strike x1, Uppercut x1, Kick x1</div>

The basic damage of the attack is listed on the Maneuver card.</div><div>You may choose to modify your attack using &quot;Style&quot; cards. Unless stated elsewhere, you may use up to two Style cards to modify a single Manuever.</div><div>When you make an <b>Attack</b> you must declare a target. &quot;I use Heavenly Monkey Kick on Bob&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>You may only play &quot;Response&quot; Maneuvers when you are the target of an attack.

If you need to draw cards and the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and place face down as the new draw pile. </div><div><br/></div><div>CHI:</div><div>Chi represents a valuable focus and resource that all high-level martial artists draw upon, consciously or subconsciously. You begin play with 5 chi tokens, and the tokens themselves can be used in several ways:</div><div><br/></div><div>1.) Change Style - By spending 2 Points of Chi, you may discard your hand and draw that many new cards.</div><div>2.) Power Special Effects - Some cards allow you to spend Chi to boost the effectiveness of their abilities. They use the Chi icon (*CHI*): to list any changes to the power when spending Chi.</div><div>3.) Manuever Cancel - By spending 2 points of Chi when you are attacked, you may cancel the effect of Maneuver Card played by another character. (For instance &quot;Ghost Dragon Whirlwind&quot; could be turned into &quot;Ghost Whirlwind&quot; or &quot;Dragon Whirlwind&quot;. ) </div><div>If the other player spent *CHI* on this Maneuver: **HACK**</div><div>A.) The CHI is cancelled out and lost forever with no effect.</div><div>B.) The CHI is refunded.</div><div>C.) The CHI is lost, but they gain the 2 CHI you used to Maneuver Cancel.</div><div>D.) You must increase the cost to cancel by the CHI they spent. </div><div><br/></div><div>HEALTH:</div><div>Occassionally, a technique will allow you to spend or manipulate your health tokens. Specifics will be found on any cards that allow this.</div><div><br/></div><div>ABSOLUTE DEFENSE Cards:</div><div>A player may completely cancel an attack against them by using an Absolute Defense card as a Reaction. </div><div><br/></div><div>Style Cards and Maneuver Cards: There are 36 Style cards, 16 Manuever Cards and 2 Absolute Defense cards. The Style and Maneuver cards all  may be played one of two ways: Top or Bottom orientation. There are different options printed on each, so each card allows you a choice in how to use it. When attacking, you *must* declare the full name of your attack. You may not use the same descriptor twice.</div><div><br/></div><div>**HACK** Wouldn't it be fun to give a special bonus to someone who yells the name of their attack when they knock an opponent out? Or a bonus for coming up with a Kung-Fu name for their character?</div><div><br/></div><div>Styles: There are six elemental affinities and six creature affinities, listed below:</div><div><br/></div><div><div>General Effects:</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Elemental:</b></div><div>&quot;Forest&quot; - Attack targets cards in hand instead of Health pool. (3 damage attack causes 3 card discard)</div><div>&quot;Iron&quot;-  +2 effect.</div><div>&quot;Lightning&quot; - Chi:Additional Target</div><div>&quot;Stone&quot; - Gain 2 Health.</div><div>&quot;Flowing&quot; - Gain 2 Chi.</div><div>&quot;Burning&quot; - Draw 2 Card</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;Dragon&quot; - If damage: Take one Chi token from from target pool and place in your pool.</div><div>&quot;Monkey&quot; - If damage: Take a card randomly and add it to your hand.</div><div>&quot;Serpent&quot; - If damage: Take 1 Health token from target and add it to your pool.</div><div>&quot;Phoenix&quot; - Chi: Regain 2 Health</div><div>&quot;Tiger&quot; - Chi: +2 Effect.</div><div>&quot;Crane&quot; - Chi: Draw a card</div><br/></div><div>There are also four types of Offense maneuvers and four types of Defense maneuvers:</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Offense</b></div><div>Kick -- Powerful single target strike. Effect: 3 damage</div><div>Punch -- Simple single target strike. Effect: 2 damage. Draw a card.</div><div>Whirlwind -- Strikes every other player. Effect: 1 damage. Hits every other player.</div><div>Throw -- May not be Blocked or Countered. Effect: 2 damage. May not be Blocked or Countered.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Defense</b></div><div>Meditation -- Effect: Recover 2 Chi.</div><div>Rejuventation -- Effect: Recover 2 Health.</div><div>Block -- Reaction. Effect: Absorb 3 damage from an incoming attack. (Does not block Throw.)</div><div>Counter -- Reaction. Effect: 2 damage.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>LATER</b></div><div>Other options down the road for manuevers:</div><div>Attack: Sweep - Reaction. Cancel effect of Mediation or Rejuvenation.</div><div>(Might replace punch and turn kick to strike)</div><div><br/></div><div>Other options for Style:</div><div>&quot;Ghost&quot; - Attack targets Chi pool instead of Health pool.</div><div>Use Health to boost like Chi.</div><div>Spend Chi to play as reaction.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Playtest notes round 1</b></div><div>Lots of chi going around. Probably need to change &quot;Chi:&quot; powers to have a bigger effect, but a singular effect.Maybe have an unmodified minor effect and then a CHI effect? If that's the case, maybe determine CHI later on?</div><div><br/></div><div>Not a lot of blocking/defense. Game seems to favor the attacker. Attack actions are too rare/valuable (maybe split so that there are ATTACK and DEFENSE cards, and the option exists on either of them.
